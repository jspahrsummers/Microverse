# Microverse

[Microverse](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Microverse_Battery) is a thin virtualization app for macOS, which allows running Linux _(and, soon, macOS)_ guest virtual machines, achieved with [macOS' own virtualization framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization).

Note that this does not do any _emulation_â€”the virtual machines run on the same hardware as the host machine (and therefore have the same architecture). This is particularly useful to create sandbox environments with minimal performance impact.

## Requirements

This project makes use of APIs from the macOS 12 (Monterey) [beta](https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/). macOS 11 (Big Sur) is unsupported.
